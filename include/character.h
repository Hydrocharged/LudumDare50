      Thinking of keeping track of buffs and debuffs in two ways:
      1. We can have a vector of strings and include and remove whatever buff/debuff applied to the character when they
      receive buff/debuff.
      2. We can create functions, such as
                isPoisoned() {
                    if (poisoned == true) { return true; }
                    return false;
                }
      And call them every round. Both are very scalable, I think that the functions while more work upfront are better
      in the long run, if we are just considering runtime because the second option is constant time O(1) compared to
      O(n) n being the size of the vector arrays created
